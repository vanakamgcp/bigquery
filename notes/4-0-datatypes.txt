
-- Datatype is a type of data. For example whether data is number or char or special chars.
-- Datatype of column only allows the data of defined datatype.

-- BigQuery supports a variety of data types to handle diverse data processing needs. 

-- STRING
-- INT64 (INTEGER)
-- FLOAT64 (FLOAT)    -- 5.50, 1.25
-- NUMERIC            -- 4.3216
-- BOOL (BOOLEAN)     -- true or false
-- DATE
-- DATETIME
-- TIME
-- TIMESTAMP

-- BYTES
-- ARRAY
-- STRUCT

1. STRING
- Purpose: Used to store text data. (Whatever the data may be,if it is enclosed in single quotes('') then it is considered as STRING data)
- Example:
  SELECT 'Hello, BigQuery' AS example_string, '123' AS num_as_string, 'true' as bool_as_string, '10.00' as dec_as_string;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing customer names, product descriptions, or email addresses.

2. INT64 (INTEGER)
- Purpose: Stores whole numbers.
- Example:
  SELECT 12345 AS example_integer;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing employee IDs, product quantities, or order numbers.

3. FLOAT64 (FLOAT)
- Purpose: Stores decimal numbers.
- Example:
  SELECT 12345.67 AS example_float;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing product prices, weights, or financial transaction amounts.

4. NUMERIC
- Purpose: Stores high-precision decimal numbers. Precision upto 38 digits.
- Example:
  SELECT NUMERIC '12345.6789' AS example_numeric;
- Real-Time Use Case: Financial calculations, such as interest rates or large monetary values.

5. BOOL (BOOLEAN)
- Purpose: Stores true/false values.
- Example:
  SELECT TRUE AS example_boolean;
- Real-Time Use Case: Indicating if a customer is active or inactive, or if a product is in stock.

6. BYTES
- Purpose: Stores binary data.
- Example:
  SELECT FROM_BASE64('SGVsbG8=') AS example_bytes;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing images, encrypted data, or file content in binary format.

7. DATE
- Purpose: Stores calendar dates.
- Example:
  SELECT DATE '2024-01-01' AS example_date;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing employee joining dates or order shipment dates.

8. DATETIME
- Purpose: Stores date and time (without time zone).
- Example:
  SELECT DATETIME '2024-01-01 12:30:00' AS example_datetime;
- Real-Time Use Case: Logging user activity timestamps.

9. TIME
- Purpose: Stores time of day.
- Example:
  SELECT TIME '12:30:00' AS example_time;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing business opening hours or schedule times.

10. TIMESTAMP
- Purpose: Stores date and time with time zone information.
- Example:
  SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS example_timestamp;
- Real-Time Use Case: Recording event logs or system audit trails.

11. ARRAY Data Type
- Purpose: Stores an ordered list of values.
- Example:
  SELECT [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] AS example_array;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing a list of product IDs purchased in a single order.

---

12. STRUCT Data Type
- Purpose: Groups multiple fields into a single composite value.
- Example:
  SELECT STRUCT('John Doe' AS name, 35 AS age) AS example_struct;
- Real-Time Use Case: Storing complex data such as a customer record with multiple attributes.

Summary
BigQuery provides diverse data types to efficiently store and query data:
1. Scalar Types: Simple values like strings, numbers, and dates.
2. Array Types: Lists of values.
3. Struct Types: Grouped fields representing a single entity.

Understanding and using these types ensures efficient and accurate data processing in real-world applications.


1.DATE:
Represents a calendar date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Example: 2024-01-01.

2.TIME:
Represents the time of the day in the format HH:MM:SS.
Example: 10:15:30.

3.DATETIME:
Combines date and time without a timezone.
Example: 2024-01-01 10:15:30.

4.TIMESTAMP:
Combines date and time with timezone information.
Example: 2024-01-01 10:15:30 UTC.
