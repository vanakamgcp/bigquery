BigQuery Notes: 
LIKE Operator

What is the LIKE Operator?
- The `LIKE` operator is used in the `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
- Patterns can include wildcard characters for flexible matching.

---

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;

Wildcard Characters in LIKE

1. `%` (Percent Sign)  
   - Matches zero or more characters.  
   - Use Case: Search for values that start, contain, or end with specific characters.

   Examples:
   - Starts with 'J':
     SELECT first_name
     FROM hr.employees
     WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
     Explanation: Matches names like "John", "James", "Julia".

   - Ends with 'n':
     SELECT first_name
     FROM hr.employees
     WHERE first_name LIKE '%n';
     Explanation: Matches names like "John", "Ethan", "Megan".

   - Contains 'ar':
     SELECT first_name
     FROM hr.employees
     WHERE first_name LIKE '%ar%';
     Explanation: Matches names like "Mark", "Clara", "Darren".

---

2. `_` (Underscore)  
   - Matches exactly one character.  
   - Use Case: Search for values with a specific character pattern.

   Examples:
   - Starts with 'J' and is 4 characters long:
     SELECT first_name
     FROM hr.employees
     WHERE first_name LIKE 'J___';
     Explanation: Matches names like "John", "Jake", "Jill".

   - Second character is 'a':
     SELECT first_name
     FROM hr.employees
     WHERE first_name LIKE '_a%';
     Explanation: Matches names like "Mark", "Jack", "Jane".

---

Escape Character in LIKE
- Sometimes, you may need to match wildcard characters (`%`, `_`) as literal values instead of their special meaning.
- Use the `ESCAPE` keyword to define an escape character.

Syntax:
SELECT column1
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern' ESCAPE 'escape_char';

Examples:
- Match a literal `%`:
  SELECT first_name
  FROM hr.employees
  WHERE first_name LIKE '100%%' ESCAPE '%';
  Explanation: Matches "100%" as a literal string.

- Match a literal `_`:
  SELECT first_name
  FROM hr.employees
  WHERE first_name LIKE 'A\_B%' ESCAPE '\';
  Explanation: Matches values like "A_Brown", "A_Baker".

---

Combining LIKE with Other Operators
- You can combine `LIKE` with logical operators (`AND`, `OR`) for complex conditions.

Example:
SELECT first_name
FROM hr.employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%' AND department_id = 10;
Explanation: Matches employees whose names start with "J" and belong to department 10.

Summary
- The `LIKE` operator is a powerful tool for pattern matching in BigQuery.
- `%`: Matches zero or more characters.
- `_`: Matches exactly one character.
- Escape Character: Allows matching wildcard characters as literals.
- Combine `LIKE` with other SQL constructs for advanced querying.
