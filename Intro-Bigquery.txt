What is Data?
    Data is raw information or facts collected for reference or analysis. 
    It can be numbers, words, measurements, or observations that are used to 
    understand and make decisions about a specific topic.

Example:
    A list of customers' names and addresses collected by a store.
    Daily temperatures recorded by a weather station.

How Much Data Is Generated Daily?
    Every day, around 328.77 million terabytes of data is generated worldwide (as of recent estimates). 
This explosion of data comes from social media, emails, online shopping, streaming platforms, 
IoT devices, and more.

Importance of Data Management
    With this massive amount of data, managing it effectively is critical. 

Poorly managed data can lead to:
    Wasted resources.
    Missed opportunities for insights.
    Reduced efficiency in decision-making.

Data management ensures that the right data is collected, stored, secured, and 
analyzed effectively to derive actionable insights.

What is a Database?
A database is a structured collection of data stored electronically for easy access, retrieval, and management.

Example of Databases:
Banking: Storing customer details, account balances, and transaction histories.
E-commerce: Keeping track of products, inventory, and orders.

In databases, data is stored in tables consisting of:
Rows: Represent individual records (e.g., a single customer's data).
Columns: Represent attributes (e.g., name, age, or account balance).

What is a Data Warehouse?
A data warehouse is a centralized system designed for storing and analyzing large volumes 
of historical data from multiple sources. 
It is optimized for queries and analytics rather than transaction processing.

Key Differences from Databases:
    Databases focus on real-time operations (e.g., ATM transactions).
    Data warehouses focus on aggregating and analyzing data (e.g., monthly sales reports).

Examples of Data Warehouses:
    Retail: Analyzing sales trends across all stores for decision-making.
    Healthcare: Storing historical patient records for research purposes.

Introduction to BigQuery
    BigQuery is Google’s cloud-based data warehouse solution. 
    It allows businesses to store and analyze massive datasets in real-time using SQL-like queries.

Scalability: Handle petabytes of data seamlessly.
Speed: Quickly process and analyze data using Google’s infrastructure.
Integration: Works well with Google Cloud services, making it ideal for data engineering tasks.

How Data is Stored in Tables
    In both databases and data warehouses, data is organized in tables. 

A table has:
Rows: Each row is a single data record (e.g., one customer).
Columns: Each column stores a specific type of data (e.g., name, email, age).

For example:
| Customer_ID | Name        | Age | Email                |
|-------------|-------------|-----|----------------------|
| 1           | John Doe    |  30 | john@example.com     |
| 2           | Jane Smith  |  25 | jane@example.com     |


In BigQuery, the tables can be partitioned (divided into smaller pieces for faster access) and 
clustered (grouped based on similar data).

Real-Time Examples
Data Example:
    A social media post contains text, images, and user reactions—all considered raw data.
Database Example:
    A database stores your login credentials and profile information when you sign up for a streaming platform.
Data Warehouse Example:
    A company collects data from its sales, customer feedback, and website traffic and uses a data warehouse to generate reports on customer behavior and future market trends.

Summary
  Understanding the importance of data, databases, and data warehouses is crucial in today’s world where data drives business decisions. 
  Tools like BigQuery make it easier to handle, store, and analyze vast amounts of data effectively, enabling organizations to stay competitive.
